# Music MVP
## Description
Road trips are always better when you are listening to the top music in the genre of your choosing. With this webpage you now have the capability to find that music with ease. When the user clicks on the page he or she will be presented with a variety of genres. The genre that you choose will then present the top 10 songs played as well as the lyrics. After clicking the plus icon the song will be stored to your very own personal playlist. Please keep in mind that every genre does not have lyrics.
